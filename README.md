# PalindromicDateFinder
Trying to find palindromes of dates

## TODO:
- Optimization regarding dates: days will always be within 01-31 range which will affect the last two digits, same with months
- Menu for custom input ranges

Current features:
- Can hard-code a value and will spit out all the days within that range and keep a list of palindromes
